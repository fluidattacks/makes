## Why

Ever needed to

- run applications locally
  to try out your code?
- Execute CI/CD pipelines locally
  to make sure jobs are being passed?
- Keep execution environments frozen
  for strict dependency control

- Know the exact dependency tree of your application?

Well, we have!

## What

Makes is an open-source, production-ready framework
for building CI/CD pipelines
and application environments.
