# ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation notice ‚ö†Ô∏è

After a [thorough review](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/issues/14974#note_2427180773) of Makes and other build system alternatives, Fluid Attacks has decided to transition fully to [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) for all our builds.

This decision brings significant benefits, including the opportunity to rely on and contribute to the incredible Nix community instead of maintaining our own build system.

It also means that Makes is no longer maintained and will be archived.

More information can be found at https://github.com/fluidattacks/makes/issues/1439.

## Why

Ever needed to

- run applications locally
  to try out your code?
- Execute CI/CD pipelines locally
  to make sure jobs are being passed?
- Keep execution environments frozen
  for strict dependency control
  against supply chain attacks?
- Know the exact dependency tree of your application?

Well, we have!

## What

Makes is an open-source, production-ready framework
for building CI/CD pipelines
and application environments.
